# Diabetes Prediction App

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction App is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-inputted medical data. It leverages the XGBoost machine learning model to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

User-friendly interface for inputting medical parameters

Real-time diabetes risk prediction

Uses XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm

Deployable as a web application using Streamlit

## Input Features

The app takes the following medical parameters as input:

Glucose level

Blood pressure

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Insulin level

Age

Other relevant health metrics

Model Used

The prediction model is based on XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm that provides high accuracy and performance. The model is trained on a diabetes dataset and optimized for classification tasks.
